            <p>He released recordings as a solo artist and as a member of The Reatards and Lost Sounds. Lindsey was born in Lilbourn, Missouri in 1980. He and his family moved to Memphis when he was 8 years old, since his father struggled to find employment in his hometown. Lindsey's recording career began at the age of 15, when a homemade demo tape he had sent to Goner Records caught the ear of former Oblivian and Goner Records’ owner, Eric Friedl. Lindsey had met Friedl and his Oblivians bandmates that year when the Oblivians played as an opening act for Rocket from the Crypt. Upon seeing the act live, Lindsey became enamored with their sloppy, lo-fi music and set forth creating his own brand of heavily distorted garage rock music.</p>
            <p>Like many great musicians before him, Lindsey suffered an early death. On January 13, 2010, he was found dead in his home in the Cooper-Young neighborhood of Midtown, Memphis. An autopsy was performed by the Shelby County medical examiner and it was determined that Lindsey had died of cocaine toxicity, and that alcohol was a contributing factor in his death.</p>
